Wow, okay... Just walked outta Last Bullet and, I swear, I'm still tasting the kinda salty, kinda stale popcorn they serve in those tiny red buckets. God, my back's killing me from those seats, but what's really messing with my head is that insane scene. You know the one with the neon lights and those weird masks? Felt like a dazy dream where you're running in molasses. Honestly thought I was in a Sonic the Hedgehog level for a sec, you know, but with more existential dread.

So the theater was packed, noisy, like a swarm of bees in a blender or something. Everyone was whispering all around, like you're in a 𝘭𝘪𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘳𝘺 full of secrets nobody was ready to share. And then there was this — was it a car chase or maybe a truck, could barely focus with crumbs in the hoodie pocket. Pretty sure I'm wearing more popcorn than I ate. Ah, yes, and somebody told me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later. Can't remember who, but it's probably a good idea. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 again might help untangle everything.

Oh, and the soundtrack? Insane. Like if you mixed a 90s video game with a cat trying to play the piano. Random, unexpected, but kinda works. My friends said something about how I should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   when I'm more, like, coherent. Not sure if they're right or I'm just beyond tired. Mind's a chaotic playlist, can't really skip any scenes because they're all just clashing into each other, you know? 

The part where that detective guy started doing his monologue under the rain felt like one of those times you’d talk to yourself in the shower. Gosh, even the rain on screen sounded like it might've been too tired to keep going.

Oh, oh, oh, and the ending! Probably can't spoil it here but let's just say, it left me as puzzled as a kitten trying to comprehend calculus. Alright, gotta wrap this up, seems I accidentally copied some code from another tab, whoops:

```csharp
public void MakeSenseOfScene()
{
    moments = new List<string>{car chase, neon lights, rain monologue};
    foreach(var scene in moments)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Processing scene:  + scene);
    }
    return // wait, does anything make sense, really?
}
```

Ugh, need to sleep. Clearly, I'm not even near making sense tonight.
